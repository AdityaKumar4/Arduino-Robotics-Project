# Arduino-Robotics-Project

> This was a workshop conducted in my college about basics of robotics and few problem tasks. 
> All the tasks and problems were solved using arduino kit. 

***In this project we were able to: ***

- Build line following robot, 
- Temperature sensing, 
- Sonar distance measuring, 
- Servo-motor control, 
- LED blinking, 
- Moving and controlling the car using computer input. 

> As the final task we were give to use the limited resources to make the best combination of the above mentioned functionality and put it all together on a bluetooth version of car which we have to control using our mobile phones.
